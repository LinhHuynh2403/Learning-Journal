# Vision

## Why did I build this?

I built this project as a personal learning journal for practicing Data Structures and Algorithms on LeetCode.
While solving problems, I often felt lost about where to start, what to focus on next, and whether I was actually improving.
This project helps me track my problem-solving process, reflect on my thinking, and turn mistakes into learning signals.

## What problem was I facing?

Although I regularly practice DSA, I struggle to identify patterns and weaknesses across topics such as graphs, trees,
sliding window, dynamic programming, DFS, and BFS.
I wanted a system that could analyze my reflections and give structured, personalized feedback instead of relying on guesswork.

## Who is this for?

This project is for students and early-career developers who are learning Data Structures and Algorithms and want
a more intentional, reflective way to improve—especially those who feel stuck despite consistent practice.
